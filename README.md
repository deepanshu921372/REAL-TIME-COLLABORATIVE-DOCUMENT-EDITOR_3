# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED: 
I have built a real-time collaborative code editor using React, Node.js, and Socket.IO. This application allows multiple users to write, edit, and view code simultaneously, with updates reflected in real-time across all connected clients. The frontend, crafted with React, provides an intuitive and interactive coding interface. The backend, powered by Node.js, efficiently manages concurrent connections, while Socket.IO enables low-latency, bidirectional communication, ensuring smooth and instant collaboration. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies to create a responsive, scalable, and collaborative platform for developers.
